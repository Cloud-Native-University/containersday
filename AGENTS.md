# AGENTS.md

This file documents how to maintain the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors content on the Containers Day site. For dev commands, build/deploy details, and general architecture, see `CLAUDE.md`.

After any change below, verify with `make serve` and check both the Spanish page and its `/en/...` counterpart.

## Sessionize sync

Sessions, speakers and the whole agenda are fetched from the Sessionize API at **build time** — nothing about them lives in this repo. Editing the Schedule Builder does not change the published site until a build runs.

**Sessionize has no webhooks.** The API is read-only and pull-based, so polling is the only integration available; anything promising push notifications (see the deleted `webhook-receiver.js` in commit `4616952`) was built against a feature that does not exist.

`.github/workflows/hugo.yaml` polls every 15 minutes. A `check` job hashes the two feeds the site renders — `/view/GridSmart` (agenda) and `/view/all` (speaker pages) — and compares that digest against the payload of the last successful deploy via the Actions cache. Unchanged means no build and no deploy, so the schedule stays cheap.

Expect **15–30 minutes** from edit to live: GitHub's scheduler drifts under load, and Sessionize serves its own ~4 minute cache (`Cache-Control: max-age=240`) on top.

To publish immediately:
- **Actions tab → Deploy Hugo site to Pages → Run workflow**, or `gh workflow run "Deploy Hugo site to Pages"`. Manual runs and pushes bypass the digest check entirely.
- If the edit was *just* made, clear the Sessionize cache first from the event's Get Code page, otherwise the build may fetch the stale cached payload.

The `SESSIONIZE_ID` env var at the top of the workflow must stay in sync with `params.themes.event.sessionizeId` in `hugo.yaml`.

### Event-day sync

The `*/15 * * * *` poll is a promise GitHub does not keep: scheduled workflows are throttled and dropped under load, and on 22 August 2026 that line fired every **25–56 minutes**. A schedule change made mid-morning sat unpublished for most of an hour while the event was already running.

So there is a second schedule, `*/5 * * * *`, that only does work while the event is on. A cron expression cannot read site config, so it fires year-round and `.github/scripts/event-window.sh` throws away the ticks that land outside the event: it reads `startDate`, `endDate` and `utcOffset` from `params.themes.event` in `hugo.yaml` — the same params the countdowns and the agenda read — and sets the `active` output the rest of the `check` job keys off. **Move the event in `hugo.yaml` and the dense poll window moves with it; there is no date written down twice and nothing to edit in the workflow.** A multi-day `startDate`/`endDate` span covers every day in it.

What is never gated: pushes, manual dispatches and the year-round `*/15` poll always check Sessionize. Only the dense tick can be skipped, and a skipped tick exits in seconds without touching the API. The script also **fails open** — an unreadable or unparseable `hugo.yaml` polls anyway and annotates the run, because a stale agenda during the event is a worse failure than a wasted build.

Twelve attempts an hour instead of four does not defeat GitHub's throttling, it only shortens the expected wait; **it is not a 15 minute guarantee.** Nothing in GitHub Actions can promise one. If the agenda on the site has to match the agenda on the wall within minutes, drive it by hand:

```shell
gh workflow run "Deploy Hugo site to Pages"
```

A manual dispatch bypasses the digest check and deploys unconditionally, so it is always safe to run and takes about a minute. On event day, run it after every Schedule Builder change rather than trusting the poll.

To test the gate without waiting for a schedule, run the script directly — `CONFIG` points it at a doctored copy of the config:

```shell
GITHUB_OUTPUT=/dev/stdout CONFIG=/tmp/hugo.yaml \
  EVENT_NAME=schedule EVENT_SCHEDULE='*/5 * * * *' DENSE_CRON='*/5 * * * *' \
  bash .github/scripts/event-window.sh
```

Editing anything under `.github/workflows/` needs a credential with the `workflow` OAuth scope — a `gh`-issued HTTPS token does not have it, so push over SSH.

## Event dates and times

Every date and time the site counts against lives in `hugo.yaml` under `params.themes.event`. **Do not hardcode a date in a template or in JavaScript** — a past incident left `¡Es Hoy!` frozen in the topbar and the wrong weekday in a tooltip because the date was written into `baseof.html`.

```yaml
startDate: '2026-08-22'   # YYYY-MM-DD
endDate: '2026-08-22'
startTime: '09:00'        # local wall clock, HH:MM
endTime: '23:59'          # when the countdown retires and the thank-you takes over
utcOffset: '-04:00'       # the venue's offset (America/Santo_Domingo)
```

`themes/event/layouts/partials/event-datetime.html` turns those into one RFC 3339 timestamp. Call it instead of writing a date yourself:

```go-html-template
{{ partial "event-datetime.html" (dict "event" .Site.Params.themes.event "which" "start") }}
{{ partial "event-datetime.html" (dict "event" .Site.Params.themes.event "which" "end") }}
```

Two consumers today, both driven off that partial so their clocks can't drift apart:

- **Topbar ticker** (`themes/event/layouts/_default/baseof.html`) — counts down to `start`; once `end` passes it removes `.topbar-countdown` from the DOM entirely.
- **Hero meta band** (`partials/countdown.html`, fed by `partials/sections/hero-slider.html`) — days/hours/minutes/seconds before `start`, `countdown.ended` ("the event has started") between `start` and `end`, then `countdown.thanks` ("thank you / see you next year") after `end`. Both strings are in `i18n/es.yaml` and `i18n/en.yaml`.

Human-readable dates are formatted from the same config: `{{ .Site.Params.themes.event.startDate | time.AsTime | time.Format ":date_full" }}`. Never type the date out in prose in a template — the one remaining hand-written date is in `params.themes.event.description` (SEO copy) and must be updated by hand when the event moves.

To move the event, change `startDate`/`endDate` (and the description) — nothing else. Verify with `make serve`: the topbar should show a live `NNd HHh MMm SSs` ticker and the hero should show four counters agreeing with it.

### Simulating another date

There is no date-override flag. To see the site as it will look during or after the event, temporarily set `startDate`/`endDate` to a past date and reload — `hugo server` picks up `hugo.yaml` changes, but restart it if a rebuild sticks on an error page. **Revert before committing.** For the agenda's "happening now" state, don't touch config: run this in the browser console on `/agenda`, since that logic reads the session times from the page, not from `hugo.yaml`:

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 5000; i++) clearInterval(i);
const now = new Date('2026-08-22T11:00:00-04:00');
document.querySelectorAll('[data-session]').forEach(c => {
  c.classList.toggle('session-card--live', now >= new Date(c.dataset.start) && now < new Date(c.dataset.end));
});
```

## Agenda content (`/agenda`)

The page is `content/sessions/_index.md` (Spanish, `url: /agenda`) and `content/en/sessions/_index.md` (`url: /en/agenda`), rendered by `themes/event/layouts/sessions/list.html`. The `_content.gotmpl` next to them generates one content page per session — **never create or edit those by hand.**

**What comes from Sessionize (not editable here):** session titles, abstracts, speakers, start/end times, room assignments, and the order of the day. Change them in the Sessionize Schedule Builder and wait for the poll (see *Sessionize sync* above) or trigger the workflow manually. Nothing in this repo can override a session's time or room.

**What is editable here:**

- **Page intro, title, description** — the front matter and body of `content/sessions/_index.md` and its `/en/` twin.
- **All UI copy** — `i18n/es.yaml` and `i18n/en.yaml`, keys under `sessions_page.*` (search placeholder, filter legends, `grid_hint`, `no_matches`, `live_now`, `jump_now`) and `session_label.*` (the topic pill labels). A topic with no `session_label.<slug>` key renders as an **empty pill** — `T` returns an empty string for a missing key — so add the key in both files whenever a new topic appears in Sessionize.
- **Topic pills** — derived from Sessionize session categories, collapsed behind a `<details>` in `list.html` because there are enough of them to push the schedule below the fold. Room pills stay expanded.
- **Break and ceremony cards** — sessions Sessionize marks as service sessions render as gray "Receso" cards and are hidden as soon as any filter is applied. Whether something counts as a break is decided in `list.html`; see commit `446d35f` for the Opening Remarks case.
- **Live-session behavior** — `list.html` adds `.session-card--live` plus an "En curso" chip to whatever session is running, shows the "Ahora mismo" jump button, and on load scrolls to the live session (skipped when the URL has a `#hash`, so deep links still win).

After changing agenda copy, check both `/agenda` and `/en/agenda`, and confirm the topic filter still narrows the schedule.

## Contrast rule (applies to every template and stylesheet)

**Light background → dark text. Dark background → light text.** Never leave it to inheritance.

`body` is dark navy (`--bg-dark`) with light text (`rgba(255,255,255,0.8)`), so *any* element that paints a light background must also set its own `color`, or its contents inherit white-on-white. This has already caused two rounds of unreadable text (`.section-container--dimmed`, the agenda `.schedule` section).

Whenever you add a `background`/`background-color`:

- Light surface → set `color: var(--text-dark)` (or `--color-primary-darkest` in legacy theme CSS). Secondary text: `--text-muted` / `#33475b`.
- Dark surface → set `color: var(--text-light)` or white.
- Set the pair **on the container**, not on each child — one declaration covers everything nested inside.
- Watch for `all: unset` in the legacy theme CSS: it resets `color` to `inherit`, so those elements depend entirely on the container being correct.

Target WCAG AA (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text). The site tokens already satisfy this: `--text-dark #1a2a36` (13.8:1 on white), `--text-muted #64748b` (4.8:1), `--accent #2378b0` (5.0:1). `--accent-light #5dade2` is **only 2.0:1 on white** — decorative use only, never text.

## Organizers

Organizers are **data-driven** — `data/organizers.json` at the repo root, a single list shared by both languages, loaded in templates as `site.Data.organizers`. It's rendered as `.organizer-card` blocks by `themes/event/layouts/miscellaneous/organizers.html` on `/organizers` (and `/en/organizers`).

Each entry:
```json
{
    "id": "<slug>",
    "name": "Full Name",
    "image": "/images/<slug>.jpg",
    "alt": "Optional alt text (defaults to name)",
    "roleKey": "cd_organizer_role_<slug>",
    "hidden": false,
    "socials": [
        { "type": "linkedin", "url": "https://..." }
    ]
}
```
`socials[].type` must be `linkedin` or `instagram` (the only icons/hover styles wired up in the template — see `$socialIcons`/`$socialLabels` in `organizers.html`); add a new type there first if a person uses a different network. `hidden: true` keeps an entry in the list (and its i18n/photo) without rendering it — used to pull someone from the page without deleting their data.

### Add an organizer

1. Add a square headshot to `static/images/<slug>.jpg`.
2. Append an entry to `data/organizers.json` (see shape above), with a new, unique `roleKey`.
3. Add the matching `roleKey` to **both** `i18n/es.yaml` and `i18n/en.yaml` with the Spanish and English role text.

### Remove an organizer

- To hide them but keep their data (reversible): set `"hidden": true` on their entry.
- To fully delete: remove their entry from `data/organizers.json`, delete the `roleKey` from both `i18n/es.yaml` and `i18n/en.yaml`, and delete the now-unused photo from `static/images/` if it isn't reused elsewhere.

## Sponsors

Sponsors **are** pure data — `data/sponsors.json` at the repo root, a single list shared by both languages, loaded in templates as `site.Data.sponsors`. This drives the `/sponsors` page, the homepage sponsor carousel, and the logo strip at the bottom of `/organizers`.

### Add a sponsor

1. Add the logo file to `assets/logos/` (this is processed by Hugo's asset pipeline via `resources.Get` — **not** `static/logos/`, which is for unprocessed static assets).
2. Append an entry to `data/sponsors.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "logo": "logos/<file>.png",
       "url": "https://sponsor-site-or-social-link/",
       "name": "Sponsor Name",
       "description": "One-line description shown with the logo.",
       "tier": "platinum"
   }
   ```
   `tier` is `platinum` | `gold` | `silver` | `community` and must match a key in `params.themes.event.sponsorTiers` (still in `hugo.yaml` — only the sponsor list itself moved to JSON).
3. `community`-tier sponsors show only on `/sponsors` and in the `/organizers` footer strip. `platinum`/`gold`/`silver` sponsors also appear in the homepage carousel (`partials/sections/our-sponsors.html`).

### Remove a sponsor

Delete its entry from `data/sponsors.json`. Optionally delete the now-unused logo from `assets/logos/` if nothing else references it.

### Initiative partners (related, separate list)

`params.themes.event.initiativePartners` is a separate list for non-sponsor program partners (e.g. funding bodies, academic partners). Same add/remove process as sponsors, but entries only have `logo`, `url`, `name`, and an optional `wide: true` for a wider logo — no `tier` or `description`.

## Volunteers

Unlike organizers and sponsors, there is **no roster stored in the repo**. `/volunteers` (`content/volunteers.md` + `content/en/volunteers.md`, layout `volunteers`) just wraps a hero + intro paragraph around an embedded **Google Form**, rendered by `themes/event/layouts/miscellaneous/volunteers.html`.

The site has no backend or database (static Hugo build on GitHub Pages), so the actual form — fields, options, required/optional flags, and any conditional logic — lives entirely on **Google Forms' side**, not in this repo. The embedded iframe just points at `params.themes.event.volunteersFormUrl` (a `forms.gle` link) in `hugo.yaml`, with `?embedded=true` appended in the template to get Google's frameless embed view. Submissions land in the linked Google Form's Responses tab (and its linked Sheet, if one is attached).

### Edit the form

- **Fields, options, conditional logic**: edit directly at the form's edit URL in Google Forms — there is nothing to change in this repo for question content.
- **Swap in a different Google Form** (or point at a new one): update `volunteersFormUrl` in `hugo.yaml` (`params.themes.event`) to the new form's `forms.gle` (or full `docs.google.com/forms/.../viewform`) URL. No template changes needed.
- **Embed height**: Google's embed has no dynamic-height API like Tally did, so the iframe uses a fixed `height="1200"` in `volunteers.html`. If a new form is noticeably longer/shorter, adjust that value so the form doesn't scroll inside its own box.
- **Menu entry**: `hugo.yaml` → `menus.main` (`identifier: volunteers`) in both the `es` and `en` language blocks.
- **Response notifications**: enable "Get email notifications for new responses" in the form's Responses tab (⋮ menu) in Google Forms — not configured in this repo.

### If you'd rather not depend on Google Forms

Swap the iframe's `src` for a different form service, or replace the whole block with a `mailto:`-based custom HTML form (fields built in this repo, no external dependency, but no dashboard/spreadsheet of applicants either) — see the git history of `volunteers.html` for a previous mailto-based version to start from.
